Wireless arduino weather system with web server. Based upon the work of several people, most notably Jean-Claude Wippler
of Jee Labs (http://jeelabs.org/).
 
The weather remote makes use of wind speed/direction sensor from SparkFun (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942),
the tempurature and humidity sensor from Sensiron (SHT11). 

Current remote node functionality:

* Li battery
* Solar charger
* RF12B sleep between transmissions - remote updates sent once a min
* Wind speed averaged over 12 samples taken every 5 seconds
* Wind burst speed recorded once per min
* Temp, humidity and dew point data provided by SHT11/15
* Light level infered from Solar cell Voltage
* Uses 8 MHz clock to reduce current requirements

Current Master node functionality:

* Web server using ENC28J60
* DHCP
* RTC using DS1307
* Barometric pressure using Freescale MP3H6115A

Current State is function prototype.

Known issues:

* Every once in a while the remote node will stop sending data. This doesn't appear to be related to the length of time
the remote has been running, environmental conditions or any other obvious cause. This is actively under investigation.

* The anemometer accuracy is questionable. I found that the reed relay outputs pretty much a square wave with 2 pulses 
per revolution which is not noted in the documents. The documentation indicates that one revolution per sec = 1.492 MPH,
however my initial testing (driving at set speeds on a calm day with the sensor on top of my truck) seem to indicate that
the value from the sensor is about 10% high. I have not re-tested after I noticed (and solved I hope) the contact bounce
problem of the reed relay.

* The Wind vane also has quite large granularity and the response from the 8 reed relays is non-linear when it comes to the
interpolated 22.5% points where two reeds are closed at the same time.

* The barometric sensor is analog and was designed for a larger pressure range than atmospheric, thus the accuracy is less 
than desirable.


Suggested Improvements:

* Replace or improve the Wind Sensor - I tried replacing the wind vane sensor board with a magentic position sensor but 
found that the magnet used either isn't close enough to activate the rotory encoder 
(AS5043  - http://www.austriamicrosystems.com/Products/Magnetic-Encoders/Rotary-Encoders/AS5043) 

* Replace the baro sensor with BMP085, or add an opamp to adjust the scale of the analog signal

* Add a new remote type (device id 2) which will capture data from the rain guage

* Push wx data to pachube (api.pachube.com)
